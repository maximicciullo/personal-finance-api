# üìã Personal Finance API - Deployment & MCP Integration TODO

This file tracks the progress of deploying the Personal Finance API and creating an MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for Claude LLM interaction.

## Phase 1: TODO File & Project Organization
- [x] Create `TODO.md` file with structured task list
- [ ] Add deployment-specific configuration files

## Phase 2: Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Create deployment configurations for cloud providers (Docker-based)
- [ ] Add environment-specific configs (staging/production)
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline configuration
- [ ] Add health monitoring and logging enhancements

## Phase 3: MCP Server Implementation
- [ ] Research MCP (Model Context Protocol) specifications
- [ ] Create MCP server component that interfaces with API
- [ ] Implement MCP-specific handlers for financial operations (CRUD, reports, calculations)
- [ ] Add MCP configuration and connection handling

## Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Test MCP server locally with Claude
- [ ] Create deployment scripts for both API and MCP server
- [ ] Add documentation for MCP usage
- [ ] Test end-to-end integration

## Phase 5: Production Deployment
- [ ] Deploy API to cloud provider
- [ ] Deploy MCP server
- [ ] Configure secure API access for MCP
- [ ] Final testing and monitoring setup

## üéØ Project Goals
1. **Deploy REST API**: Get the Personal Finance API running in production
2. **MCP Integration**: Create an MCP server that allows Claude to interact with the financial API
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Ensure Claude can manage transactions, generate reports, and perform financial analysis

## üìù Notes
- Current API uses in-memory storage (easy to migrate to database later)
- Docker configuration already exists
- Clean Architecture with good separation of concerns
- Comprehensive test coverage already in place
